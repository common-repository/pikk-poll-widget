This plugin lets you add a short, 2 choice poll to your post.  The poll is submitted to Pikk, and your post is linked back from Pikk.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you add a 2 choice poll to your post which simultaneously appears on Pikk.com.  This lets you engage your readers
and also get new traffic from Pikk.  This plugin gives you the option to add the Digg badge (which shows the vote count), the Pikk badge (which also shows the vote count), the large Pikk widget and/or the Pikk Poll.
See http://www.pikk.com/info/widgets\_how\_to for examples, or look at the screen shots.  You can choose any combination of these widgets to show on your post. When you submit your poll to Pikk, you are asked to give a headline (short description or question) along with a longer pitch (a paragraph or two that summarizes your post or your position on whatever you're writing about).  Once submitted, everyone who comes to Pikk will see your story.  Pikk displays all stories with links back to your post.  The most voted on stories rise to the top.
Pikk gives you a large number of choices such as "Yes or No," "Fair or Foul" and "Funny or Lame," for example.  You can also make a custom poll by filling out custom choices.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `pikk-digg-plugin.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's it. On each post, you should now see the checkboxes on the bottom of the post edit page.
